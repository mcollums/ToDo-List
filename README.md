# TodoList with Node/Express/Handlebars


[Link to app](https://todo-list-11.herokuapp.com/)


## Technologies

This To-do List was written with `javascript`, `node.js`, `express`, `mySql`, and `handlebars.js`.


## How to use

You can look at the tasks already available to you and click any that you'd completed. If you'd like to add an item to the list, just put one in the input box and click submit.


### Routes

This program uses express to create routing to different pages. Because of this, you will not see `.html` at the end of web page.


## ORM

This application uses a homemade ORM to help prevent SQL injections. 

## Models

Models are used to create calls based on the ORM
